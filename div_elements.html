    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        The Artificial Intelligence program of the piaic takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology,
        via teaching program in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and teaching
        deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and endind with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
    <p>
        The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students in program in open source technologies like Linux, Docker,
        Kubernetes, Javascript, Node.JS, React and React Native while introducing students to Development of Microservices
        and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>

    <h2>Blockchain Computing </h2>
    <p>
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric)
        and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, Javascript, on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces
        them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps,) frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and iin-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-Service
        (Baas) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token
    </p>

    <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet of Things program introduces the students to open source development technologies like Rust, Embedded
        Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes while making them efficiant in developing Microservicesfor IoT Edge,
        IoT Cloud, and voice Computing for device control.
